    <marquee><h2>Nano Relief: The evolution of fast pain relief!</h2></marquee>
    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p> Nano Relief is a product of pain relieving nanomachines. The nanomachines are preloaded with strong opioid pain relievers, and come equipped with a neurological scanner to sense your trauma.</p>
      <img src="">
      <p>Nanobots were created in 1974, and they are still a somewhat primitave technology, but Nano Relief takes it to the next level. The bots themselves are small enough to pass through your veins, without the danger of clottage.</p>

        <p>       The technology within each and every single Nano Capsule is a full range neurological scanner, as well as opioids a level above anything that the human race has ever created, ensuring fast, and complete pain relief.
          Unlike other opioids, the Nano Relief opiate does not fog the head, and cause any sort of dehabilitating effect, which was a worry with the technicians, until it was discovered through tests that the opiate not only stops pain, but also enourages a faster firing rate of the neurons in the brain.<p>
          <h3>How It Works</h3>
          <p> The neurological sensors inside of the nano capsules will only trigger when they receive a signal from the nerves around it while they are on their way to the brain. When the sensors intercept this signal, tiny hatches that lead into the opioid compartment are opened, and the opiate is carried through the blood stream, all throughou the body, numbing pain wherever the pain origin point is. <p>
            <h3> Installation </h3>
            <p> Nano Relief capsules are inserted into the body through a long needle which is inserted into the carotid artery. the nanomachines will spread throughout the body through your bloodstream. When the Nano Capsules are installed their will be a price of fifty dollars per capsule, and the base amount of capsules is ten, though you can choose whether you want to lower this amount, or raise it.
              <h3> Risks</h3>
            <p> Any one person is not permitted to have more than thirty capsules inserted at one time, for if this threshold is crossed, the man or woman would experience negative effects such as nausea, unconciousness, bleeding from the eyes, depression, bleeding from the nose, an irregular heartbeat, weakness of muscles, pain in the spleen, migraines, pain in the rectum, pain in the colon, heartburn, anxiety, fear, a feeling of claustrophobia, inability to breathe, blood clots, the failure of the heart, failure of the liver, and the failure of both kidneys. </p>
